## Color Palette
Not to work less but I am not used to Markdown so palettes are a bit harsh to write. Anyway, nothing as simple as to check the colors thanks to the screenshots or by directly downloading the extension and seeing it yourself !

#### **Collapse Purple**

Just check out the colors in :  
`.vscode/extension/xgr-collapse-v0.1.0/themes/Collapse Purple-color-theme.json`

The colors are basically : Purple, Pink, Blue & a bit of yellow, orange and red.
